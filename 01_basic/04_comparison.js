// console.log("2" > 1);
// console.log("02" > 1);

console.log(null > 0);
console.log(null == 0);
console.log(null < 0);
console.log(null <= 0);
// equality check (==) and comparison check work differently. When we are using comparison check then at that time, null gets converted into a number 0 and then checks happen.

// There are many different cases in the comparisons, so always refer documentation and also avoid the confusing code. Always keep it clean.
